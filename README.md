# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To implement user needs into a program you need detailed user stories. It makes sense logically that if you want a final product to be representative of a user’s vision you will need to ask questions that help explore those user’s vision. User stories allow us to take an idea from a user and craft it into reality. 
These stories don't just give us quick snippets in the form of bulleted information. The stories are a walk through the user’s idea which can be interpreted by other users, developers, and anyone else involved to help craft a final product. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My personal approach for developing programs is focused on questions and information. I believe that one of the most important features of agile development is its ability to adapt to user needs as they change. With those things in mind, I like to accumulate as much information as I can before starting the project. I want user stories with detailed questions and responses. As the project grows, I want all members of the development team to ask big questions and if they feel there is a need for more information to properly develop a feature, I want my team to seek out those answers. At the end of a project the goal is to create a functional program that truly satisfies our users. If the users have a product, they feel they helped create and can see their ideas come to life I will feel like I have done my job properly. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member is everything in software development. Agile focuses on small teams with a substantial amount of conversation. Daily and weekly meetings are only the baseline to a successful Agile Development project. Within each sprint there will be many times when one team member needs to collaborate or gather information from another member. With various levels of expertise, questions will be asked and as a good team member it is everyone’s responsibility to help others and answer any questions they can. Being a good team member requires a positive attitude, desire to help others and clear communication.
